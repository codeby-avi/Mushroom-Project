# 🍄 Mushroom Project – Edibility Classifier with ML

## 🧾 Project Abstract

This project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using machine learning techniques. It combines an intuitive Streamlit interface with robust models trained on the UCI Mushroom Dataset. The web app also includes a secure authentication system and educational sections on mushrooms' ecological, biological, and nutritional roles.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** 🌐 – for web interface
- **SQLite** 🗃️ – for authentication
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model training
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

---

## 📥 Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeby-avi/Mushroom-Project.git
cd Mushroom-Project
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv mushroom-env
source mushroom-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
python Main.py

```

---

## 🔒 Authentication System

- User login/signup
- Password hashing
- SQLite database

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User Login/Signup** through a secure interface.
2. **Select Mushroom Features** using dropdowns and forms.
3. **Model predicts** whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
4. Display results with **confidence score** and explanations.
5. Includes pages like:
   - 📚 **Mushroom Wisdom**: Biological, nutritional, and ecological info,Fun facts, types, and safety tips.
    - ✅ **Gallery**: project information ,behind the sceen and team.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

Three classification models were trained and evaluated:
- 🔍 Logistic Regression
- 🌲 Random Forest Classifier
- 📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
---

## 📦 Feature Engineering

- Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder
- Removal of ambiguous data
- Feature selection based on correlation

---

## 🗃️ Data Preprocessing

- UCI dataset (8124 samples)
- Null/missing handling
- Train-test split (80:20)

---

## 📈 Data Exploration & Visualization

- Class distribution
- Feature correlation heatmaps
- Count plots for each feature

---

## 🧠 Model Selection Rationale

- Logistic Regression: Simple baseline
- Random Forest: Robust and accurate
- SVM: Great for small, high-dimensional data

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 94.6% | 0.95 | 0.94 | 0.94 |
| Random Forest | 99.1% | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 |
| SVM | 98.2% | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 |

---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation
