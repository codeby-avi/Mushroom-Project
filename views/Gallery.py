        The **Mushroom Classification Project** focuses on differentiating between edible and poisonous mushrooms using machine learning. This is achieved through two unique models:
        
        - **Model 1**: A user-friendly classifier where you input physical characteristics of a mushroom (e.g., cap shape, color, and odor) to determine its safety.
        - **Model 2**: A dataset-driven classifier that processes large datasets of mushroom features and predicts their edibility in batches.
        
        This system ensures both individual users and researchers can safely classify mushrooms with ease.
