        Welcome to the **Mushroom Classification Project**! This advanced system uses machine learning models to help classify mushrooms as either **edible** or **poisonous** based on their physical features.
        
        The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform for mushroom enthusiasts, researchers, and foragers to identify mushrooms quickly and safely.

        In this project, we have developed two models:
        - **Model 1**: Input the characteristics of a mushroom to predict if it's edible or poisonous.
        - **Model 2**: Upload a mushroom dataset and classify multiple mushrooms automatically.

        Our project uses two powerful models to classify mushrooms based on their characteristics:

        1. **User Input-based Classification**:
            - Users provide details about a mushroom‚Äôs features (e.g., cap shape, cap color, odor) via dropdown menus and text inputs.
            - The model then predicts whether the mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on these inputs.

        2. **Dataset-based Classification**:
            - Users upload a dataset of mushrooms with their features.
            - The model classifies each mushroom as either edible or poisonous in bulk.
        
        **Key Features**:
        - Fast and accurate predictions.
        - Easily accessible for both beginners and professionals.

        - Always consult an expert before consuming any wild mushrooms.
