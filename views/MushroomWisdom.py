        **Mushroom Classification** is a vital task that involves distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. This project leverages machine learning techniques to automatically classify mushrooms based on their features. Accurate classification of mushrooms is essential to ensure the safety of people, as many mushrooms can be toxic or deadly if consumed.

        Our system offers two models:
        - **Model 1**: A user-friendly tool where users input characteristics of mushrooms to identify whether they are edible or poisonous.
        - **Model 2**: A dataset-based classifier where users can upload a mushroom dataset to predict the classification of various mushrooms.

        Mushrooms are widely consumed as food around the world. However, many species of mushrooms are poisonous and can lead to severe health issues or even death if consumed.

        The two models developed in this project aim to help:
        - **Identify Edible Mushrooms**: By classifying mushrooms based on physical characteristics, we help users determine which mushrooms are safe for consumption.
        - **Avoid Toxic Mushrooms**: Toxic mushrooms are often mistaken for edible ones, causing dangerous consequences. Our model helps differentiate them based on specific features.
